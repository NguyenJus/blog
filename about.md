I'm a master's student in the Greater Boston Area currently studying artificial intelligence. 

My research interests are in artificial reasoning and general intelligence in the scope of problem solving and strategizing. In recent years, IBM, DeepMind, and OpenAI have been able to teach general intelligence agents how to play strategy/arena games such as Backgammon, Go, Chess, StarCraft, and DoTA2 at a very high level. In many problems, it is important for us as humans to learn from and understand agents' actions. We have already been able to see some behavioral patterns evolving in agents in current research. Should a true general intelligence model come to fruition, it would be cool to be able to "learn" from the AI's "teaching." In essence, we train an agent on some difficult problem. We then learn from the agent, applying our own heuristics and learnings from the AI, to more efficiently solve various problems ourselves.

Prior to joining the artificial intelligence field, I studied chemistry and biology as an undergraduate. I conducted research in analytical chemistry (auto-catalytic plating) and focused coursework largely on genetics/genomics. Maybe not so coincidentally, my interest in AI began with genetic and evolutionary training algorithms.
