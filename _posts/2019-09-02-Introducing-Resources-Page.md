You may have seen the resources tab in the navigation bar recently and wondered what it was. I think it's pretty self explanatory but I want to give a formal introduction with some logistics. Introducing... the resources page (and paper archives)! In these, I've collected valuable resources that have helped me along the way that other people may find useful. CS is a rapidly-growing field and there's always more to learn whether it be through MOOC's or papers. On top of this, I've added my about page!









## Resources

This tab is a collection of all the useful online courses I've taken and currently taking. It also provides a link to the paper archives. I purposely left out school coursework as it is not something that people can readily pick up and study. In the future, I may add other online resources besides coursework.

## Paper Archives 

You can get here through the resources tab. On top is a (hopefully small) list of papers that I am interested in reading. Further down is a list of papers that I've read along with three-sentence summaries. It is important to summarize readings to facilitate better understanding. The relatively strict summary format is as follows:

```
1st sentence: Overall topic of research
2nd sentence: The scope of the problem
3rd sentence: Application based on my own opinion
```

This structure is not as concise as I'd like, but it is even more difficult to properly fit all important information in two-sentence summaries. 

Sometimes I may not have a solid understanding of the research or topic. In this case, I may choose to summarize anyway and mark it with an * or I may omit the summary altogether. These unsummarized papers will be at the bottom of the list.

## About

A new tab for my about me. I'm in the process of combining my website and the blog as there is little reason to upkeep both when everything can be done on one source.

## Contact Page

Coming eventually...

## In Conclusion

All layouts are subject to change, and they definitely will as I find better ways to present the information. Everything is still in progress. Hopefully these resources are useful to you readers.
