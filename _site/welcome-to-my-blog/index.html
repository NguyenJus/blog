<p>Hi, I’m Justin. Welcome to my blog! I am a master’s student in CS coming from a background in biology and chemistry. My current interest is in creating a working AI model to play various puzzle and strategy games. The list so far is Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Sudoku, and Tetris. However, I am quite lazy to recreate the games in a private environment. This led to an interesting way to approach the games as you will soon see.</p>

<p>Why CS?</p>

<p>I changed to CS because I found that CS, particularly the subfield of AI, has so many cool projects and problems to enjoy. When I code something up, I’m always feeling a rush to find out why things work, how to make them better, and what other features I can implement in the program. I am constantly learning new ways to approach and solve problems. This mental stimulation coupled with the depth of the field (as well as generally being decent/good at programming) has heavily impacted my shift into CS.</p>

<p>I started undertaking small personal projects about a month ago. Throughout the journey, I have had some successes as well as some failures. As a scientist, I have the urge to report on my findings. I’d love to share what I learn as both a way to educate readers and to document my work.</p>

<p>In the next few days, I will write up a proposal to my current umbrella project. I will also report on my journey through creating ManiaBot. After that, the posts will slow down until I am ready to report on the next step.</p>
