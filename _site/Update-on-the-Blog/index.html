<p>I wanted to reiterate and update my goals for this blog as well as my goals as a computer science student. I wanted to think both about previous blogs and future blogs.</p>

<h2 id="blog-goals">Blog Goals</h2>

<p>The primary goal of this blog is to document my path towards my interest in computer science. I would like to write about anything significant that I learn from projects, readings, or videos. Currently, I’m doing a ton of reading into reinforcement learning - you can see in the resources tab of this blog.</p>

<p>The other primary goal of this blog is to continue to write. I anticipate the need for tons of writing in the future and it would be awful if my writing ability were to dwindle from lack of practice.</p>

<p>Then there are secondary goals that just come naturally with the blog. For one, I hope that employers can see my passion and work and will hire me one day. For another, I hope to inspire some reader to pursue computer science. These goals are not the focus, however.</p>

<h2 id="improving-the-blog">Improving the Blog</h2>

<p>I have a list of things I want to improve on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be more verbose. Some posts have too many words for what was accomplished.</li>
  <li>Quit procrastinating. I have been posting a month after my discoveries.</li>
  <li>Continue using visual cues. I like seeing pictures and videos adn will continue to do that.</li>
  <li>Focus on reinforcement learning. This field, or similar, is what I’ve decided to pursue.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="updates-as-a-student">Updates as a Student</h2>

<p>Around this day last month, I found out that the type of learning I’m interested in, reinforcement learning, is so broad that calling my interest “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence” does it no justice. In fact, artificial intelligence is so broad that I would dare say it could be its own major separate from computer science. Looking retroactively, all of my goals have been to have an AI learn how to do things by itself without human guidance. As such, I have decided to focus my master’s thesis and Ph.D. on reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>There are tons of applications of reinforcement learning - multiagent, partially observable, learning under uncertainty, etc. I’m never entirely sure how to explain my interests. First, I would like to build a reinforcement learning method that can solve problems too complex for my brain. Since I am no Einstein, perhaps I can train an EinsteinAI that will solve problems for me (this is an exaggeration). The question I often provide is: “play X game for me one million times. What is the most optimal way of playing that game?” Second, I would like to see a reinforcement learning method that can provide reasoning to its choices. The question for this point is: “in chess, beyond estimated win probability, what makes 1. E4 the best opening move?” I’m also interested in coordinated reinforcement learning agents. Currently, reinforcement learning agents have one or a few “brains” to solve their problems. Human brains have many subsections that all focus on different goals. Can this be applied to reinforcement learning? I know some of these seem impossible. Perhaps, as I learn more, I will understand why they are impossible. Perhaps alternatively, as I learn more, I will conduct research that takes us a step towards these interests. I need to eventually concretely label my interests so that I can write research proposals…</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>You may see plenty more reinforcement learning projects as I continue to learn. Or not - my next semesters are packed for coursework and research. We’ll see.</p>
