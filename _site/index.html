  <p>Over a month ago, I was rushing to get entry into Blackshard Nexus, the final raid in <a href="http://maplestory2.nexon.net/en">MapleStory2</a> at the time. The raid required a specific level of upgraded gear that needed to be acquired in a small amount of time. Although upgrade systems are all luck, we can manipulate the expected probabilities to our favor and have, overall, a better chance at making cuts. To do this, I simulated the game’s enchantment system and threw millions of runs at it! I can’t say that the outcome helped me exactly since it’s all an RNG system, but it certainly helped me pick a method to enchant my items with. In the end, I made it in and cleared the raid on my first week! (my username is hidden)</p>

  <p>I wanted to reiterate and update my goals for this blog as well as my goals as a computer science student. I wanted to think both about previous blogs and future blogs.</p>

  <p>About a month ago, a friend approached me and asked if I could make a typing bot since it could be similar to my <a href="https://nguyenjus.github.io/blog/ManiaBot/">ManiaBot</a>. I immediately figured I would need to train the AI on the font to detect the letters that it needed to type. Since I was not confident in machine learning and the project was on a time-constraint, I declined. Two days later, I found Google’s Tesseract OCR, sparking my journey into creating a new AI.</p>

<p>Although the gif is bad quality, you can see how fast (can go faster!) and how correctly (green words!) the AI is typing!</p>

  <p>I recently viewed DeepMind’s talk describing their previous successes with AlphaGo, AlphaGoZero, and AlphaStar. In the lecture, DeepMind described not only their successes, but the importance of their research in many applicable fields. As you may know, DeepMind was and still is one of my primary points of inspiration in my journey in AI/vision. I highly recommend anyone interested in AI to watch it:</p>

  <p>As I mentioned in the <a href="https://nguyenjus.github.io/blog/ManiaBot/">ManiaBot Post</a>, the AI can easily be repurposed to do tasks other than play Mania games. Just for fun, I decided to convert the AI to an auto-potter for <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/news">Path of Exile</a>. When I get to low health (under 35%, but this can be modular), the AI automatically uses a potion for me faster than average human reaction time!</p>
